# Project Lead Weekly Plan (23rd Sept - 30th Sept)

## Daily Tasks

### 1: Crawler Enhancement and Planning
- Review and optimize existing crawler code
- Implement advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms

        ## 1. Network-related Errors
        - [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed requests
        - [ ] Use exponential backoff for retries
        - [ ] Set a maximum number of retries
        - [ ] Handle connection timeouts
        - [ ] Deal with DNS resolution failures
        - [ ] Manage SSL/TLS certificate errors

        ## 2. HTTP Status Code Handling
        - [ ] Properly handle 3xx redirect codes
        - [ ] Implement a maximum redirect depth
        - [ ] Handle 4xx client errors (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found)
        - [ ] Manage 5xx server errors with appropriate retries

        ## 3. Content-related Errors
        - [ ] Handle malformed HTML/XML
        - [ ] Manage encoding issues (e.g., incorrect character encoding)
        - [ ] Deal with oversized pages (set a maximum page size)

        ## 4. Crawler-specific Error Handling
        - [ ] Implement a mechanism to handle crawl depth limits
        - [ ] Manage URL frontier overflow
        - [ ] Handle duplicate URL detection and management

        ## 5. Resource Management
        - [ ] Implement proper connection pooling
        - [ ] Manage memory usage (e.g., clearing unnecessary data)
        - [ ] Handle disk space issues for data storage

        ## 6. Logging and Monitoring
        - [ ] Set up comprehensive error logging
        - [ ] Log error types, URLs, and stack traces
        - [ ] Implement real-time alerts for critical errors
        - [ ] Create a dashboard for error rate monitoring

        ## 7. Recovery Mechanisms
        - [ ] Implement checkpoint system to resume crawls after crashes
        - [ ] Develop a mechanism to re-queue failed URLs
        - [ ] Create a system for graceful shutdown and restart

        ## 8. Rate Limiting and Politeness
        - [ ] Implement adaptive rate limiting based on server response
        - [ ] Handle cases where crawler is banned or blocked

        ## 9. Validation and Sanitization
        - [ ] Validate and sanitize all input URLs
        - [ ] Implement safeguards against malicious redirects

        ## 10. External Dependencies
        - [ ] Handle errors from external libraries or APIs
        - [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for critical dependencies

        ## 11. Testing
        - [ ] Develop unit tests for each error handling mechanism
        - [ ] Create integration tests simulating various error scenarios
        - [ ] Perform stress testing to ensure stability under error-prone conditions


## Notes
- Continuously update project documentation as you implement new features
- Keep a daily log of challenges faced, decisions made, and lessons learned
- Prepare a detailed progress report to share with your teammate, highlighting areas where their frontend work will integrate

Remember to stay flexible and adjust the plan as needed based on the challenges you encounter and any new insights you gain during the week.

v4
adding basic frontend to the project



todo
1. learn spring structures[class organisation] - entity , controllers , service , repostiory - learn how to think about this with given problem statements make questions using ai , and try to structure and build the spring logic

2. scalability and maintainabilty



upcoming tasks 
### 2: URL Frontier and Crawl Strategy
- Develop a sophisticated URL frontier management system
- Implement prioritization algorithms for crawl order
- Begin work on politeness policies and rate limiting

### 3: Data Processing and Storage
- Design and implement a robust data processing pipeline
- Set up a database for efficient storage of crawled data (consider MongoDB for flexibility)
- Develop data cleaning and normalization procedures

### 4: Decentralization Architecture
- Research decentralized architectures suitable for web crawling
- Design the core components of your decentralized system
- Start implementing basic inter-node communication

### 5: Distributed Task Management
- Develop a system for distributing crawling tasks across nodes
- Implement mechanisms for load balancing and fault tolerance
- Begin work on a central coordinator or use a decentralized coordination mechanism

###  6: API and Integration
- Design and implement a RESTful API for interacting with the crawler
- Develop endpoints for submitting URLs, retrieving results, and managing crawler settings
- Start on a basic web interface for monitoring crawler status

###  7: Testing, Documentation, and Planning
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Update technical documentation with new features and architectural decisions
- Plan next week's tasks and long-term project roadmap

## Additional Tasks (if more time is available)
1. Implement content extraction and classification features
2. Develop a system for handling different content types (e.g., HTML, PDF, images)
3. Start work on a plugin system for extensibility
4. Research and plan for handling JavaScript-heavy websites
5. Begin implementation of data analytics features

## End of Week Deliverables
1. Enhanced crawler with advanced features (URL frontier, politeness, etc.)
2. Initial implementation of decentralized architecture
3. Functional API for crawler interaction
4. Comprehensive test suite and updated documentation
5. Detailed plan for next week and updated long-term roadmap
